        <title>Klaus Schulze 1947-2022</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;As a teenager I felt a certain degree of pride in being a Klaus Schulze fan. His work was hard to find in record shops, and he didn’t get radio airplay (even on those European radio stations that were sometimes accessible on the shortwave band after dark), which meant that one often had to buy his LPs unheard. And the listening could be a challenge: tracks of 30 minutes duration, which meant narrower grooves on an LP, not ideal when pressed by Island UK who were notorious for using sub-standard cast-off vinyl from their classical releases.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;iframe style=&quot;border-radius:12px&quot; src=&quot;https://open.spotify.com/embed/album/4QNKVVSKtnWETW17gzihFu?utm_source=generator&quot; width=&quot;100%&quot; height=&quot;380&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot; allow=&quot;autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; fullscreen; picture-in-picture&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m pretty sure my first purchase was Mirage, and on first listening it seemed pretty opaque: 30 minutes of Moog-filtered noise on side 1, and a relentless sequenced pattern on side 2. I might have given up at that stage, but I came across a compilation LP called Brainwaves featuring various artists from the German Brain label, and this featured a short extract of a Schulze track called Stardancer: dynamic, melodic, percussive. That was enough to persuade me to give Schulze another go, and eventually I discovered the full-length version of Stardancer on the Body Love soundtrack. It’s one of many tracks which evidence Schulze’s skills as an improvisational keyboard soloist.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think I had accidentally stumbled into Schulze’s creative peak, although many folk will argue that earlier works such as Blackdance and Timewind (or even Cyborg) should feature. For me, many repeated listenings to Mirage caused it to open and unfold into a truly deep, expansive and contemplative experience, and 40 years on I still find it incredibly immersive and rewarding. It is hard to overestimate its impact.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;iframe style=&quot;border-radius:12px&quot; src=&quot;https://open.spotify.com/embed/album/4M8LtVeYa55bP7jkKvFrx9?utm_source=generator&quot; width=&quot;100%&quot; height=&quot;380&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot; allow=&quot;autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; fullscreen; picture-in-picture&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of his other work of the period, the double album “X” is also strong and immersive, particularly the futuristic track Heinrich von Kleist, and the title track of the Dune album is a masterful piece of composition, with a beautiful reverberant but contained atmosphere. (Both Heinrich von Kleist and Dune heavily feature the Eventide harmoniser, which saw brief popularity in the late 1970s - see also Tangerine Dream’s Force Majeure.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;iframe style=&quot;border-radius:12px&quot; src=&quot;https://open.spotify.com/embed/album/62jy0gLKN5x0VoHP4ZJsu9?utm_source=generator&quot; width=&quot;100%&quot; height=&quot;380&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot; allow=&quot;autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; fullscreen; picture-in-picture&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The shift from analogue to digital instruments and production in the mid 1980s affected Schulze strongly, and he seemed to shift away from immersive atmospherics and into sampled collage. He was incredibly prolific in the digital age, to a fault: some 40 albums plus numerous boxed set collections, editions and works. In my opinion, most are weak and even verge on unlistenable, but there are some gems, usually when Schulze veers back into the analogue domain: the “Dark Side of the Moog” collaborations with Pete Namlook are generally presentable and, in places, really good, as is much of the work with Lisa Gerrard. And to be fair, some of his “digital” albums such as Audentity and Trancefer are strong.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have been long frustrated with this apparent emphasis on quantity rather than quality (telegraphed, in fact, by the sleeve notes in Mirage) but there’s enough superb work in his catalogue to make Klaus Schulze an incredibly important figure in electronic music, and a great loss.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Listen/Move on Bandcamp</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;It’s been a long time coming, but we finally have Listen/Move on Bandcamp. It’s divided into its two timelines, which was always the original intended structure, loosely envisaged as “journey” and “destination”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://cassiel.bandcamp.com/track/listen-move-timeline-1&quot;&gt;Timeline 1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://cassiel.bandcamp.com/track/listen-move-timeline-2&quot;&gt;Timeline 2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The artwork for the timelines is scanned from the two CD pressing runs, the first for &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theplace.org.uk/&quot;&gt;The Place&lt;/a&gt; Dance Theatre in London, the second for general release.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Longer term, the plan is to release a series of 30-minute-or-so “übertracks” as a follow-on from the &lt;a href=&quot;/project/minute-cubes/&quot;&gt;Minute Cubes&lt;/a&gt;. Listen/Move is the launch vehicle for those.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;row&quot;&gt;

  &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

        <title>Donate Yourself</title>
        <description>&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Donate Yourself is a new work – an Augmented Reality experience created by artist Stacey Pitsillides with body&amp;gt;data&amp;gt;space. It blends sound and 3D visuals to spark debates about our organs, tissue and body data, accessed by the public through augmented reality via QR codes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Find out more about the project and how to access the AR experiences &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.onecellatatime.org/exhibits/donate-yourself/&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Donate Yourself by &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.bodydataspace.net/who-we-are/stacey/&quot;&gt;Stacey Pitsillides&lt;/a&gt; with &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.bodydataspace.net/&quot;&gt;body&amp;gt;data&amp;gt;space&lt;/a&gt; (2021). A One Cell at a Time commission with the Human Cell Atlas research initiative:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Designed and creatively directed by Stacey Pitsillides in collaboration with the interaction design collective body&amp;gt;data&amp;gt;space.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The digital AR experience has been co-created with the body&amp;gt;data&amp;gt;space team using the b&amp;gt;d&amp;gt;s AR development project: &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.bodydataspace.net/who-we-are/core-team/ghislaine/&quot;&gt;Ghislaine Boddington&lt;/a&gt; (Creative Co-Direction), &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.bodydataspace.net/who-we-are/core-team/tadej/&quot;&gt;Tadej Vindis&lt;/a&gt; (Project Development and Production), &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.bodydataspace.net/who-we-are/core-team/nick/&quot;&gt;Nick Rothwell&lt;/a&gt; (Sound Design and Technical Development) and &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.bodydataspace.net/who-we-are/associate/ivor/&quot;&gt;Ivor Diosi&lt;/a&gt; (AR Development and 3D Animation). With research and insights from Holly Standing and Luke Sellers. Donate Yourself is produced for One Cell at a Time by Dominic Smith.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Donate Yourself is created as part of the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.bodydataspace.net/2020/12/research-development-project-launch-datum/&quot;&gt;AR gifting development project&lt;/a&gt; at body&amp;gt;data&amp;gt;space, supported by Innovate UK and the University of Greenwich (2021-22).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One Cell at a Time is a programme of public, creative engagement activities, commissions and talks, inspired by the Human Cell Atlas, bringing together arts and communities, patients and researchers. Funded by Wellcome and led by the Wellcome Sanger Institute, One Cell at a Time aims to deepen public understanding of the revolutionary impact it will have on our understanding of the human body.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>The Protocol: Sound Design</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;The Protocol has been doing really well in short film awards over the last few months: more details &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.avadancecompany.com/the-protocol-film.html&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;. I am really pleased for the entire team, and also pleased to have a specific sound design award for the score. OK, so the awards are monthly, but 31 days of fame is much better than 15 minutes.&lt;/p&gt;
